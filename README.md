#This is my fourth challenge here in GitHub. I'm practicing the functionality of adding if/else and switch statements, dictionary, learning about optionals,
adding a countdown timer and linking it to a progress view and finally learning the steps to debug my code.

Topics learnt:

¬ Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
¬ The Swift Timer API
¬ Conditional statements - If/Else
¬ Conditional statements - Switch
¬ Functions with outputs
¬ How to use the ProgressView
